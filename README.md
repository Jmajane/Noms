# User Stories
- Always wanting to start tracking my food but, it is so hard to choose which method to use.  I don't want to have to buy a scale to weigh my food or measure everything I am eating. Why isn't there something for people just learning about this.

- Why is fasting recommended? Are you saying that I can't eat for 12+ hours inorder to create healthy eating habbits?

- I know that tracking your food is important. Can we just keep track of the healthy vs not healthy food that we have? Just being able to see what foods I had is what I am looking for.
